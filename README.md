# Golang Relay TodoMVC

This is a experiment to merge the front-end part of the [`todo-modern`](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-examples/tree/master/todo-modern) relay example with a Golang [GraphQL / Relay implementation](https://github.com/graphql-go/relay).  I wasn't sure whether the graphql-go implementation would work with relay-modern, and it does.

This project would not happen without extensive pre-existing code from [Facebook](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) and the above projects.  When I figure out what the proper attribution should be, I will add it.
